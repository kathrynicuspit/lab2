<br>Why Yes? Because this option is future-wise, and I donâ€™t really have any particular course that I want to pursue (plus I heard this course is in-demand means I wonâ€™t be having any trouble getting a job).<br>

<br>I.T.

<br>Hobbies / Interests / libangan: Watching anime, playing the piano, singing, having deep and meaningful conversations with friends, and loved ones.<br>

<br>What do you expect to learn from this course (Web Programming)? I was amazed with the educational background and the experience our professor has in the field, that is why I expect to learn a lot of relevant stuff about Web programming. ðŸ˜Š<br>

<br>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major? Since IT is a very broad field, I really want to know what area of expertise I should focus. I also want to be skilled and excellent in what I do. <br>
