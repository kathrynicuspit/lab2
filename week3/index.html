<br>What do you expect to learn from this course (Web Programming)? I was amazed with the educational background and the experience our professor has in the field, that is why I expect to learn a lot of relevant stuff about Web programming. ðŸ˜Š<br>

<br>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major? Since IT is a very broad field, I really want to know what area of expertise I should focus. I also want to be skilled and excellent in what I do. <br>
