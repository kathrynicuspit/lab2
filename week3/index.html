<h1 style="font-size:60px; background-color:#f09797; font-family:Garamond">Priceless</h1>
  <p><i>Mirror Mirror, Mirror on the wall <br> Telling those lies, pointing out your flaws </i> <br>
  <b>That isn't who you are </b><br> <small>It might be hard to hear, but let me tell you dear</small> <br> 
  <strong>If you could see what I could see I know you would believe </strong> <br> <em>That isn't who you are</em></p>
 
 <p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
 
<blockquote cite="https://genius.com/For-king-and-country-priceless-lyrics">
This is a song from the band "For King and Country". Running counter-culture, Luke and Joel Smallbone wrote "Priceless" to convey the preciousness and purity with which God sees each of us.
