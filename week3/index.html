<br>Course: BSIT<br>
<br>Scholarship? Yes / No If yes, %? type? Yes, public school discount 50%<br>
<br>Transferee / Second Course? Attended one-year in Music College in church after Senior High.<br>
<br>Did you choose this course? Yes <br>

<br>Why Yes? Because this option is future-wise, and I donâ€™t really have any particular course that I want to pursue (plus I heard this course is in-demand means I wonâ€™t be having any trouble getting a job).<br>

<br>I.T. Experience: Programming / Gaming / Others: Aside from the projects I made and the lessons that were taught in school from junior high school up until now, I donâ€™t have any experience in programming outside. So far, the schools Iâ€™ve been in taught me HTML/CSS, Java, Phyton in SHS and College.<br>

<br>Hobbies / Interests / libangan: Watching anime, playing the piano, singing, having deep and meaningful conversations with friends, and loved ones.<br>

<br>Goals in life / pangarap sa buhay: To be able to live a stable, earning a salary that could support my lifestyle. Having time for serving God and improving my skills as a musician as well as doing what God has called me to doâ€”share His goodness and lead people closer to Him.<br>

<br>What do you expect to learn from this course (Web Programming)? I was amazed with the educational background and the experience our professor has in the field, that is why I expect to learn a lot of relevant stuff about Web programming. ðŸ˜Š<br>

<br>What do you want to learn to help you in your chosen Major? Since IT is a very broad field, I really want to know what area of expertise I should focus. I also want to be skilled and excellent in what I do. <br>
